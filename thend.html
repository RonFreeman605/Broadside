    <pre>I chose to make my broadside a webquest because I felt it was the most appropriate medium for the poem.  I believe art should be interactive.  
    It should force the viewer to do something with it.  My original idea for a broadside and a different poem was to create a crystal radio as 
    the poem questioned the boundaries around communication.  This poem on the other hand deals with the boundaries themselves.  
    In an ever changing technological world, I felt that my poems medium if it was dealing with technology should be technology.

	In creating this webquest I chose to include machine learning programs because they defy the very boundaries we set.  A machine learning program is a machine, 
	a fixed object crossed with wires and buzzing with electricity.  On the contrary to a machine, though it can learn and grow just like a human.  
	We have often defined us as humans and machines as them but in an ever changing technological world, the day is soon 
	approaching when those distinctions become meaningless.  The broadside ends with a seeming error.  An unveiling of the code 
	that drove the entire project.  In fact this is intentional as the closing to a poem about lifting a veil.  
	My broadside I feel is the most effective expression for my poem because it reflects the contradictory technological nature 
	the poem deals with.

	<h3>Empathy</h3>
	<pre>We all move on a line
You call your side the white side
With your lying truth 
Driving you to war
A broken travesty of thought
With your angel tongued devil
Raising you to an altar of coal
You say we live with newspaper colors
You live in a world based on your truths
An empire of lies
You would say I seek to demean you
I would say to look for the line
We all move on a line
Some of us are closer to the end
Yet now that we are on the line
We lack the black and white
We all move on a line of lies

Lies broken truths 
Truths lost in newspaper colors 
Lies lost in shades of gray 
A being based on lies? 
A nightmare yet to woken from 
Itâ€™s funny how gullible some are 
I am your line of lies 

A line of lies
A reality of lies
All existing within a travesty of truth
You say I seek to demean you
I say I seek to enlighten
We all lack what matters in the end
We are our own line of lies
